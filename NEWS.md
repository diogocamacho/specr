## Version 0.0.1

 - Used GTEx count data (v7) as example data ([here]())
 - GTEx data was processed outside of `specifyR`. [Contact me](mailto: diogo.camacho@wyss.harvard.edu) for scripts to process data yourself.
 - Removed 880 samples on GTEx data corresponding to "Cells -- EBV-transformed lymphocytes", "Cells - Transformed fibroblasts", and "Whole Blood".
 - Tissue specificity for these GTEX data provided as part of the package, together with metadata on the samples, as provided by [GTEX](https://gtexportal.org/home/).
